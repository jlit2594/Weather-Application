## Purpose
CLIMA instantly returns weather info for any location that is entered. That includes current conditions, an hourly forecast, and a five-day forecast. The application also logs recent locations so the user can switch between them.

## How To Use
It's easy! Just enter a location, preferably a city, and let the application do the work for you.

## Technologies Used
This application was built with JavaScript and uses a Bootstrap framework, as well as your typical HTML and CSS. 

## Credits
Clima was built entirely by myself.
